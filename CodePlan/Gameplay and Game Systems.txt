Some shared things with Objects and Character classes

Implementing Logic
-Basic Controls (wasd movement, later on escape to pause and space to attack)
-Falling (check finite state machine)
-Score
-Player and enemy health (unless all enemies die in one hit)

Finite State Machine
-Game loop for gameplay, checks if enemies on screen are within a certain distance of the player and starts their
movement loop.
-Checks if the player is in the air and causes them to accelerate towards the ground if they are. (Use a VerticalSpeed
variable to make a sort of gravity? if the jump key is held the acceleration is a reduced amount until the peak is reached)

Classes
-GameObject
-MovableGameObject (inherits from game object, has methods for movement to be used by player and enemies)
	Attribute for movement speed to be set in more specific instance. Virtual class?
-Enemy (Has Attribute for Health and amount of points it is worth to kill)
-Player (Attribute for Health)
-EnemyProjectile? (If we have enemies that fire a projectile, it has movement speed and is destroyed on contact
	with the player or terrain)
-Platform(Inherits from GameObject)
	Uses an image loaded at the start of the level.
	Stops player and enemies from falling
	Destroys projectiles that hit it.
-GameScore (Created at the start of each level or kept throughout?)
	Keeps track of points earned for killing enemies or collecting items? (Hat Coins?)
-HatCoins? (potentially multiple sizes with different values)
